# tools
Additional utilities and tools added in support of Leeds September 2016 CCP course and PSMR 20187 workshop. For Leeds, the main files were `ccp_grappa.m` to perform the reconstruction of undersampled data, and, `ccp_full_samp_recon.m` to reconstruct a 3D data set. These are now outdated. The `explore_*` files are typically for looking at HDF5 files.

Files with example data are available from the CCPPETMR website Downloads page - https://www.ccppetmr.ac.uk/downloads.
